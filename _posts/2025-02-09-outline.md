I am currently studying toward the following certifications:

- Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)
- AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator
- Hashicorp Certified: Terraform Associate

I am also working on the following Projects:

- Containerized Zabbix and ELK Stack
- Bullet Journal Task Management System
