My name is Glenn Lewis, and along with being a DevOps Engineer, I am a husband, a dog-father, and a musician.

### Background

Holds a certificate in Cybersecurity from the University of Texasâ€™s Bootcamp. I am skilled in automation (SALT, Ansible, Terraform), scripting in Python and Bash, and corporate compliance. Has implemented ground-up infrastructure monitoring at two companies, implemented open-source host management solution via Proxmox, and has deployed and managed CI/CD via Jenkins and Kubernetes. My strengths in project management and planning and my expertise in Linux administration make me an excellent addition to any technical team.
